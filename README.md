# Computer Software Engineering Findings

# Introduction
This project started out as my attempt to choose an open source project to contribute to, preferably a programming language of global impact.
The criteria for choosing a project are the impact on the global economy and my own biased and perhaps not entirely rational motivations.
Since these may be opposed to each other, I started on a journey to discover my own biases and try to uproot any irrational motivations.

# Contribute towards General AI or to an existing impactful programming language
There is a conflict in my mind whether I should contribute to the development of artificial intelligence, towards its generality, as worked on for example in Google Deepmind. I deem general AI most important and seems to be in line with the times. But on the other hand my motivations and feelings tell me I should contribute to a programming language, which I find easier, and thus more practical to get started hands-on with. I'm not sure I'm sufficiently intelligent, I just have an insecure feeling about it, to contribute towards general AI, which is why I instead set off on a journey to discover the impact of various programming languages on software engineering and thus the economy of the world.

# Are all programming languages created equal?
On one hand, as Bob Martin says, all programming languages are just [sequence, selection and iteration](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1010660993851117569?lang=en). Are they therefore created equal? People do have different preferences, but are they rational? Some people argue that [mathematics must be beautiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty), a position taken by G. H. Hardy, and one may think that the same may be true about programming, but I think only very short algorithms and programs can be beautiful, not complex programs that deal with the real world, simply because they are too large and complex to be held in anyone's mind, and if they are too complex to be held they are too complex to be understood in their totality. This means that being rational in software development boils down to having intelligent people who apply rational thinking based on heuristics and statistics. Another reason is that the inputs to large computer programs quickly explode combinatorially such that there is no way of testing all inputs.

# Personal bias
Given that I want to contribute to an impactful programming language I want to know more about which features are statistically and economically useful in a programming language in order to decide on a language to contribute too. As a personal criteria or bias I also must note that I want to contribute to a programming language which has a company behind it where I could potentially look for a job later on, and this, due to personal reasons, excludes Microsoft, where I've worked before, even though I like the F# programming language. I do currently have a bias towards statically typed functional programming languages. I find functional beautiful and elegant, but that is not necessarily a rational motivation. On the other hand I do also feel that the cognitive load is higher when writing functional code. Let's also remember that the selecting the right tool for the job is also important, and that for small scripts and one-off jobs dynamic and imperative may be the most efficient even though for large software engineering other tools, say statically typed and perhaps functional, may be more appropriate. There is never a substitute for having intelligent rational people do the software development, because as we said earlier, testing for all possible inputs is impossible and we have to resort to heuristics (a philosophy or discipline of software engineering perhaps). You can't just have an irrational person rely on the compiler or running limited tests until the program works for some particular cases and expect it to be maintainable, robust, secure and efficient. 

# What features are statistically and economically useful in a programming language?
Before we start, is this even the right or all-encompassing question? I think for the industry it is the most relevant one, but it completely omits the impact of psychology in software development. Whether a language is psychologically beneficial to use for a human is a neglected question, as I consider myself more knowledgeable about programming than about psychology. With this "disclaimer" out of the way, I proceed to research which features are useful in differentiating the economical impact of various programming languages.

# Is static typing useful?
